# Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) using Seaborn Car Crashes Dataset
Overview
This repository contains a Python script that demonstrates Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) using the Seaborn in-built dataset car_crashes. RFE is a feature selection technique that recursively removes features, and the script uses Seaborn to visualize the relationship between the selected features and the target variable.
